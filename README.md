## Overview

This is a small sample taken from one of my recent assignments. 

## Program explainations:
### Tiny Browser:
A small console based web browser using html 1.1. It is very limited in what webpages it can display, one working one is acme.com.

### Github Explorer:
A small application that lets the user connect to github with their REST api, allowing them to open repositories and create/edit issues.

### Lame Scooter:
A kind of useless in its current shape, but modular, scooter rental service. With this local implementation you can only access and read information about stations stored in a local json file.

### TinyHtmlReader:
Small html reader class used by the Tiny Browser.

### ExtraExtensionMethods:
Holds a simple extension to make deserializing objects from HttpResponseMessages easier.

### ConsoleUtils
Has a few console related functions. 
- Getting user input in string or int format.
- Buffering console write output, allowing better write performance by writing more less times.
